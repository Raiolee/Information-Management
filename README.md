A project on the course Information Management. We were assigned the "Supply and Vendor Management System" but it looked more like an e-commerce website.

How to use the system:
Step 1: Download the zip file
Step 2: Unzip the zip file
Step 3: Make sure to open a server for the database
Step 4: Run the script on a RDBMS (MySQL Workbench was used)
Step 5: Open the index.php file on your localhost browser
Step 6: You can log in as admin/supplier/customer

Email and Password:
Admin: admin@gmail.com Password: admin123
Supplier: supplier@gmail.com Password: supplier123
Customer: customer@gmail.com Password: customer123
